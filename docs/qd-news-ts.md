# qDesk News

# Description

qDesk News is a module for [qDesk](https://qDesk.org). It's accessible across qDesk, you can use it with qDesk Messages, qDesk Social and other qDesk modules. This module allows peers on the network to exchange, discuss and rate news items democratically.

Use [Quest OS](quest-os-js) in your applications and you can use the underlying channels and data in your own application by booting with [Quest News JS](quest-news-js).

qDesk News allows users to join the newsroom. It offers the ability to share news items and to discuss and collectively moderate news content. qDesk Market is a module for [qDesk](qDesk) and it's built on [Quest OS](quest-os-js) which makes use of the [Interplanetary Filesystem](https://ipfs.io), [IPFS GossipSub](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-05-20-gossipsub-v1.1/) and [qDesk](qDesk), our example app based on [Angular10](https://angular.io/).

We have chosen Angular/Electron as an example environment because we believe it offers the best accessibility for developers coming from any other language/framework. The Quest Network is already being used in Python on PyQt5 and we aim to provide the underlying library in Go and wherever possible in Rust as well.

[qDesk](qDesk) works in the browser, as an Electron on Windows, Mac and Linux and Android using Cordova.
