# qD Calendar

# Description

qD Calendar is a module for qDesk. It's accessible across qDesk, you can use it with qD Social, qD Messages and other qD modules.

qD Calendar offers the ability to share events and event invitations, as well as to evens publicly posted by peers on the network. qD Calendar is connected to [qD Social](qd-social-js) and uses the station supplied by qD Social. 

qD Calendar and qDesk Social are modules for [qDesk](qDesk) and it's built on [qOS](quest-os-js) which makes use of the [Interplanetary Filesystem](https://ipfs.io), [IPFS GossipSub](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-05-20-gossipsub-v1.1/), [IPFS DAGs](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/merkle-dag/), and [qDesk](qDesk), our example app based on [Angular10](https://angular.io/).

We have chosen Angular/Electron as an example environment because we believe it offers the best accessibility for developers coming from any other language/framework. The Quest Network is already being used in Python on PyQt5 and we aim to provide the underlying library in Go and wherever possible in Rust as well.

[qDesk](qDesk) works in the browser, as an Electron on Windows, Mac and Linux and Android using Cordova.
