# Quest Engine

# Description

An Angular compatible NodeJS library for the use with [Quest OS](quest-os-js) that allows to create and participate in quests on the network.

We have chosen Angular/Electron as an example environment because we believe it offers the best accessibility for developers coming from any other language/framework. It is already being used in Python on PyQt5 and we aim to provide the underlying library in Go and wherever possible in Rust as well.

[qDesk](qDesk) works in the browser, as an Electron on Windows, Mac and Linux and Android using Cordova.
