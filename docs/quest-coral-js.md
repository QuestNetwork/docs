> IPFS Datastore For The Quest Network

# Description

IPFS Datastore For The Quest Network.

# Installation & Usage

``npm install @questnetwork/quest-coral-js@0.9.6``

We recommend to use our [quest-cli](quest-cli) to test and build the package.
Pro Tip: Put a file in your `/bin` that runs the quest-cli like so `node /path/to/quest-cli/index.js` from any folder on your system. It's much nicer!
