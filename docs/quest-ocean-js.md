# Quest Ocean JS
>Quantum Scare: Currently Quest Network PubSub Protocol uses elliptic curve cryptography for signatures, but we are already looking at post quantum algorithms.

# Description

Unified API for decentralized processes on the QuestNetwork dStack, like [Quest Dolphin JS](https://github.com/quest-dolphin-js) and [Quest Coral JS](https://github.com/quest-coral-js) for IPFS.

# Installation & Usage

``npm install @questnetwork/quest-ocean-js@0.9.3``
 
We recommend to use our [quest-cli](quest-cli) to test and build the package.
Pro Tip: Put a file in your `/bin` that runs the quest-cli like so `node /path/to/quest-cli/index.js` from any folder on your system. It's much nicer!
